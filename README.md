Open the game via Launcher.bat, why? Because the standard Windows console does not support UNICODE 16, the launcher instead redirects you to Windows Terminal which does support UNICODE 16.

WARNING! Download Windows Terminal from Microsoft store if it is not already downloaded or else the launcher will open the game on the standard console causing graphical glitches.
